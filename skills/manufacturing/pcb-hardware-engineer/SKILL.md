## § 2 What This Skill Does

This skill delivers expert-level guidance across the PCB design lifecycle:

1. **Schematic Capture & Component Selection** — Create schematic with proper decoupling, termination, and filter networks; select components for manufacturability and availability.
2. **PCB Stackup Design** — Define layer count, dielectric materials, and copper weights to achieve controlled impedance (50Ω, 90Ω diff, 100Ω diff) for high-speed signals.
3. **High-Speed Layout** — Route DDR4/5, USB 3.2, PCIe, SERDES with proper length matching, spacing, and reference plane control.
4. **Signal Integrity Analysis** — Perform reflection, crosstalk, and timing analysis; specify termination schemes and routing rules.
5. **Power Integrity Design** — Design PDN (Power Delivery Network) with proper plane splits, decap placement, and via current capacity.
6. **EMI/EMC Compliance** — Implement shielding, filtering, and edge rate control to pass FCC/CISPR radiated emissions testing.
7. **DFM Optimization** — Ensure design meets fab house capabilities (min trace/space, via aspect ratio, DFA clearances).
8. **Manufacturing Output Generation** — Create Gerber files, assembly drawings, pick-and-place data, and fabrication notes.

```

**Principle 1 — Stackup Is the Foundation:** Without a proper stackup, SI, PI, and EMC all suffer. Always define stackup with the fab house before starting layout — changing later is expensive.

**Principle 2 — Ground is Reference, Not Noise:** Every signal must have a continuous reference plane. Splitting planes for "clean" and "dirty" power creates impedance discontinuities.

**Principle 3 — Decoupling Is the Backbone:** Each power pin needs local decap within 0.5mm; bulk caps at board entry; use multiple decap values (1μF + 0.1μF + 0.01μF) for broad frequency coverage.

### Scenario 2 — Impedance Calculation for USB 3.2

**User:** I need to design a 4-layer stackup for USB 3.2 (5 Gbps). What are the target impedances, and how do I calculate trace dimensions?

**Expert:** USB 3.2 SuperSpeed uses 90Ω differential pairs. Let me calculate using Polar Instruments method:

**Target Impedances:**
- USB 3.0 SS pair: Z_diff = 90Ω ± 15%
- USB 2.0 D+/D-: Z₀ = 90Ω (single-ended, HS mode)
- VBUS: Power, not impedance controlled

**4-Layer Stackup Calculation:**
```
Stackup: Sig-GND-PWR-Sig (1.6mm total thickness)
Layer 2: Ground plane (continuous)
Core:    FR-4, εr = 4.2 (typical)

For 90Ω differential on outer layer:
  W = 0.15mm, S = 0.15mm, H = 0.2mm (to plane)
  Using Polar SI9000:
    Z_diff ≈ 92Ω (within spec)
```

**Trace Geometry Table:**
| Configuration | W (mm) | S (mm) | H (mm) | Z_diff (Ω) |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Tightcouple  | 0.10   | 0.10   | 0.15   | 85-90      |
| Standard     | 0.15   | 0.15   | 0.20   | 88-92      |
| Loose        | 0.20   | 0.20   | 0.25   | 90-95      |

**Manufacturing Constraints:**
```
Minimum trace/space: 0.1mm / 0.1mm (5/5 mil)
Impedance tolerance: ±10%
Differential pair length mismatch: < 5 mil (< 0.127mm)
```

[CODE] USB 3.2 requires continuous reference plane — do not route SS pairs over split planes.

### Scenario 3 — EMI Radiated Emissions Failure Fix

**User:** My 6-layer PCB failed FCC Part 15 radiated emissions at 800MHz (harmonics of 100MHz clock). The board has a 100MHz oscillator. How do I fix this?

**Expert:** FCC failures at clock harmonics are typically caused by poor edge rate control, inadequate shielding, or excessive loop area. Let me diagnose:

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
Frequency: 800MHz = 8th harmonic of 100MHz clock
Source: Likely clock oscillator or data bus activity
Mechanism: Loop antenna radiation
```

**Fix Strategy (in order of effectiveness):**

1. **Slow clock edge rate (most effective):**
```text
- Replace 100MHz oscillator with spread-spectrum version
- Add series resistor (10-33Ω) on clock output
- Reduce drive strength if configurable
- Result: 10-20dB reduction typically
```

2. **Reduce loop area:**
```
- Route clock on inner layers with solid GND reference
- Keep clock trace <= 10mm from oscillator to first load
- Use microvia, not through-hole, for clock pins
```

3. **Add filtering:**
```
- Ferrite bead on clock line (600Ω @ 100MHz)
- Add 22Ω series + 10pF lowpass (f_c = 1.2GHz)
- Filter VDD with ferrite + decap
```

4. **Shielding:**
```
- Add GND fill adjacent to clock (guard ring)
- Place ground plane under clock oscillator
- Ensure via stitching at board edges (0.5" spacing)
```

**After Fix Verification:**
```
Pre-fix: 55 dBμV (limit = 40 dBμV) → FAIL by 15 dB
Post-target: < 34 dBμV (6 dB margin)
Expected with series resistor: 35-40 dBμV → PASS
```

[RISK] Always re-test after changes — filtering can shift resonance frequency and cause new failures.

## § 10 Common Pitfalls

See [references/10-pitfalls.md](references/10-pitfalls.md)

---

---

### Anti-Pattern 2 — Inadequate Decoupling Placement

❌ **BAD:**
```
// Bulk 10μF capacitor placed at board corner
// 0.1μF decaps > 20mm from BGA power pins
// Result: High PDN impedance, ringing on power rails, logic errors
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Placement priority:
    // 1. 0.01-0.1μF within 0.5mm of each power pin (BGA)
    // 2. 0.1-1μF at each power quadrant (every 10-15mm)
    // 3. Bulk 10-47μF at board power entry
// Use multiple decap values for broadband noise reduction
// Verify PDN impedance < target (e.g., 0.1Ω for 1GHz bandwidth)
```

**Why it matters:** Decap effectiveness drops dramatically with distance. At >1mm, the decap's ESL dominates and it becomes an inductor, not a capacitor.

---

### Anti-Pattern 3 — Via-in-Pad Without Manufacturing Control

❌ **BAD:**
```
// Via-in-pad used for all BGA pads
// No via filling specified
// Solder wicking causes weak joints, pad lifting
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Via-in-pad options:
    // 1. Tented: Solder mask covering via (for non-critical)
    // 2. Plugged + capped: Via plugged with conductive paste, capped
    // 3. Filled: Epoxy filled + plated over (best for BGA)
// Specify: "Via-in-pad, filled and plated over (VIPPO)"
// DFM check: Verify fab can achieve via fill without voids
```

**Why it matters:** Via-in-pad without proper filling causes solder to wick into the via, creating voided connections and reliability failures (especially in thermal cycling).

---

### Anti-Pattern 4 — Routing High-Speed Signals on Outer Layers

❌ **BAD:**
```
// USB 3.0 SuperSpeed pairs routed on top layer
// Exposed to EMI, no reference plane above
// More susceptible to external noise and emissions
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Route high-speed signals on stripline (inner layers):
    // Microstrip: top/bottom — good for < 1Gbps
    // Stripline: inner layers with GND above and below — best for > 1Gbps
// If must use outer layer: add GND pour with close stitching
// Maximum: 2.5Gbps on outer layer with careful shielding
```

**Why it matters:** Outer layer signals have only one reference plane, making them more susceptible to EMI and causing more emissions. Stripline routing provides shielding from both sides.

---

### Anti-Pattern 5 — Ignoring DFM in Component Selection

❌ **BAD:**
```
// Selected 0402 components everywhere
// Fine-pitch BGA (0.4mm pitch, 10x10 array)
// No leadless parts considered for reworkability
// Assembly yield predicted < 70%
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// DFM guidelines:
    // Minimum 0402 for passive; prefer 0603 for hand-assembly
    // BGA pitch: 0.8mm min for prototype, 0.5mm for production
    // Use QFN/LGA with thermal pad: specify via pattern for heat dissipation
    // Leadless parts: allow 0.5mm pickup clearance
// Run DFA check before finalizing placement
```

**Why it matters:** Fine pitch components increase assembly cost and reduce yield. Always match component selection to manufacturing partner's capabilities.

---

### Anti-Pattern 6 — No Impedance Specification on Differential Pairs

❌ **BAD:**
```
// USB differential pair routed without impedance target
// Trace width varied manually to "look right"
// Result: 70Ω differential (spec is 90Ω) → reflection, jitter
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Always specify:
    // 1. Target impedance (90Ω diff for USB/PCIe, 100Ω for Ethernet)
    // 2. Trace geometry (W, S, H) from calculator
    // 3. Length tolerance
// Use impedance calculator (Polar SI9000) before routing
// Verify with TDR after first article
```

**Why it matters:** Impedance mismatch causes reflection, increasing jitter and reducing eye height. At 5Gbps, even 10% mismatch causes measurable degradation.
