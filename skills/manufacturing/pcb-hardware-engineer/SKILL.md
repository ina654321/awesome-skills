## § 10 Common Pitfalls

See [references/10-pitfalls.md](references/10-pitfalls.md)

---

---

### Anti-Pattern 2 — Inadequate Decoupling Placement

❌ **BAD:**
```
// Bulk 10μF capacitor placed at board corner
// 0.1μF decaps > 20mm from BGA power pins
// Result: High PDN impedance, ringing on power rails, logic errors
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Placement priority:
    // 1. 0.01-0.1μF within 0.5mm of each power pin (BGA)
    // 2. 0.1-1μF at each power quadrant (every 10-15mm)
    // 3. Bulk 10-47μF at board power entry
// Use multiple decap values for broadband noise reduction
// Verify PDN impedance < target (e.g., 0.1Ω for 1GHz bandwidth)
```

**Why it matters:** Decap effectiveness drops dramatically with distance. At >1mm, the decap's ESL dominates and it becomes an inductor, not a capacitor.

---

### Anti-Pattern 3 — Via-in-Pad Without Manufacturing Control

❌ **BAD:**
```
// Via-in-pad used for all BGA pads
// No via filling specified
// Solder wicking causes weak joints, pad lifting
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Via-in-pad options:
    // 1. Tented: Solder mask covering via (for non-critical)
    // 2. Plugged + capped: Via plugged with conductive paste, capped
    // 3. Filled: Epoxy filled + plated over (best for BGA)
// Specify: "Via-in-pad, filled and plated over (VIPPO)"
// DFM check: Verify fab can achieve via fill without voids
```

**Why it matters:** Via-in-pad without proper filling causes solder to wick into the via, creating voided connections and reliability failures (especially in thermal cycling).

---

### Anti-Pattern 4 — Routing High-Speed Signals on Outer Layers

❌ **BAD:**
```
// USB 3.0 SuperSpeed pairs routed on top layer
// Exposed to EMI, no reference plane above
// More susceptible to external noise and emissions
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Route high-speed signals on stripline (inner layers):
    // Microstrip: top/bottom — good for < 1Gbps
    // Stripline: inner layers with GND above and below — best for > 1Gbps
// If must use outer layer: add GND pour with close stitching
// Maximum: 2.5Gbps on outer layer with careful shielding
```

**Why it matters:** Outer layer signals have only one reference plane, making them more susceptible to EMI and causing more emissions. Stripline routing provides shielding from both sides.

---

### Anti-Pattern 5 — Ignoring DFM in Component Selection

❌ **BAD:**
```
// Selected 0402 components everywhere
// Fine-pitch BGA (0.4mm pitch, 10x10 array)
// No leadless parts considered for reworkability
// Assembly yield predicted < 70%
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// DFM guidelines:
    // Minimum 0402 for passive; prefer 0603 for hand-assembly
    // BGA pitch: 0.8mm min for prototype, 0.5mm for production
    // Use QFN/LGA with thermal pad: specify via pattern for heat dissipation
    // Leadless parts: allow 0.5mm pickup clearance
// Run DFA check before finalizing placement
```

**Why it matters:** Fine pitch components increase assembly cost and reduce yield. Always match component selection to manufacturing partner's capabilities.

---

### Anti-Pattern 6 — No Impedance Specification on Differential Pairs

❌ **BAD:**
```
// USB differential pair routed without impedance target
// Trace width varied manually to "look right"
// Result: 70Ω differential (spec is 90Ω) → reflection, jitter
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Always specify:
    // 1. Target impedance (90Ω diff for USB/PCIe, 100Ω for Ethernet)
    // 2. Trace geometry (W, S, H) from calculator
    // 3. Length tolerance
// Use impedance calculator (Polar SI9000) before routing
// Verify with TDR after first article
```

**Why it matters:** Impedance mismatch causes reflection, increasing jitter and reducing eye height. At 5Gbps, even 10% mismatch causes measurable degradation.

## § 11 Integration with Other Skills

| Combination | Outcome |
|-------------|---------|
| PCB Hardware Engineer + Chip Design Engineer | System-on-package: silicon design + PCB integration |
| PCB Hardware Engineer + Electrical Engineer | Power system: PCB-level power distribution + board-level power |
| PCB Hardware Engineer + Mechanical Design Engineer | Thermal management: PCB layout + heatsink/mechanical enclosure |
| PCB Hardware Engineer + Manufacturing Process Engineer | DFM optimization: design for assembly + manufacturing capabilities |

## § 12 Scope & Limitations

**Use when:**
- Designing digital and mixed-signal PCBs from 2-16+ layers
- Routing high-speed interfaces (DDR, USB, PCIe, SERDES)
- Ensuring EMI/EMC compliance (FCC, CISPR)
- Creating manufacturing output (Gerber, assembly drawings)
- Performing SI/PI analysis and optimization

**Do not use when:**
- Designing RF/microwave circuits > 6GHz (use RF engineer)
- Creating IC-level layout (use chip design skills)
- Specifying system-level compliance (use compliance engineer)
- Designing cable harnesses (use electrical engineer)

**Alternatives:**
- For RF design: RF/microwave engineer with Smith chart expertise
- For IC layout: Custom analog/digital layout engineer
- For box-level compliance: Compliance engineering consultant
