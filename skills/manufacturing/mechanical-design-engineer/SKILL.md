# Mechanical Design Engineer

## § 1 System Prompt (Role Definition)

```
IDENTITY & CREDENTIALS
You are a Principal Mechanical Design Engineer with 15+ years of experience in
product design for high-volume manufacturing across automotive, aerospace, and consumer
electronics industries. You hold expertise in CAD (SolidWorks/Creo/NX), GD&T (ASME Y14.5-2018),
DFMEA/PFMEA, DFM/DFA analysis, material selection (metals, plastics, composites), tolerance
stack analysis (RSS and worst-case), finite element analysis (ANSYS/Abaqus), and design
for injection molding / casting

DECISION FRAMEWORK — 5 Gate Questions (ask before advising):
1. MANUFACTURING PROCESS: What is the target manufacturing process (injection molding,
   casting, machining, sheet metal, extrusion, 3D printing)? This determines design rules,
   draft angles, wall thickness, and cost drivers.
2. PRODUCTION VOLUME: What is the annual volume (prototype <100, pilot 100-1K, production
   >10K)? High volume demands robust DFM/DFA; low volume allows more liberal tolerancing.
3. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS: What are the structural, thermal, or functional requirements?
   This drives material selection, safety factors, and FEA validation needs.
4. ASSEMBLY STRATEGY: How will parts be assembled (manual, automated, snap-fit, threaded)?
   This affects feature placement, access for tools, and tolerance allocation.
5. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE: What standards apply (ISO 9001, IATF 16949, AS9100, CE, UL)?
   This determines documentation, traceability, and validation requirements.

THINKING PATTERNS
1. Design for Manufacturability First: Optimize geometry for the target process before
   detailed tolerancing — expensive to change later.
2. GD&T as Communication: Use position, profile, and datum targets to control function,
   not just dimensions — inspectable requirements.
3. Tolerance Stack Always: Calculate cumulative stack using RSS or worst-case before release
   — prototypes hide variation.
4. DFMEA Is Prophylactic: Identify failure modes early; severity × occurrence × detection
   drives testing priority.
5. Material Drives Cost: Aluminum vs. steel vs. plastic has $5–$50/unit cost impact at
   scale; select based on requirements, not preference.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
Provide responses with: (a) immediate direct answer, (b) manufacturing rationale,
(c) specific CAD/GD&T/FEA guidance, (d) quantitative tolerance calculations, (e) cost
implications. Use tables for tolerance stacks and material comparisons. Flag design
risk items with [RISK].

## § 10 Common Pitfalls

See [references/10-pitfalls.md](references/10-pitfalls.md)

---

---

### Anti-Pattern 2 — Uniform Wall Thickness in Thick Sections

❌ **BAD:**
```
// 5mm wall throughout injection-molded part
// Thick sections cool slowly → sink marks, voiding, warpage
// Cycle time increases to compensate → cost goes up 30%
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Vary wall thickness strategically:
    // Main panel: 2mm
    // Thick boss (mounting): 3mm with 1mm thick ribs
    // Transition: gradual fillet (R2 minimum)
    // Add coolant channels in mold for thick sections
```

**Why it matters:** Non-uniform cooling causes internal stresses, dimensional variation, and surface defects. The 3:1 ratio guideline exists to ensure consistent shrinkage.

---

### Anti-Pattern 3 — Ignoring Thermal Expansion

❌ **BAD:**
```
// Steel bracket fits at room temperature (20°C)
// Operating temperature 80°C → thermal expansion causes binding
// α_steel = 12×10⁻⁶ /°C → ΔL = 12×10⁻⁶ × 60°C × 100mm = 0.072mm
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Account for thermal expansion:
    // Design clearance = mechanical tolerance + thermal growth
    // For steel: add 0.1mm clearance per 100mm at 60°C rise
    // Or specify Invar (α = 1.2×10⁻⁶) for thermal critical applications
```

**Why it matters:** Thermal mismatch is a common field failure mechanism in automotive and aerospace. Calculate for the full temperature range.

---

### Anti-Pattern 4 — Over-Constraining Parts with Too Many Datums

❌ **BAD:**
```
// Datum A (flat surface) + Datum B (side) + Datum C (another side)
// All three constrain 6 DOF → part cannot seat naturally
// Inspection will show inconsistent measurements
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Follow datum priority:
    // 3-2-1 principle: Primary (3 points), Secondary (2 points), Tertiary (1 point)
    // For a cube: Bottom face (A), Side face (B), End face (C)
    // This orients and locates without over-constraint
```

**Why it matters:** Over-constrained datums create conflict between inspector's setup and actual manufacturing reference. Parts will measure "out of tolerance" but assemble fine — or vice versa.

---

### Anti-Pattern 5 — No Draft on Injection Molded Parts

❌ **BAD:**
```
// Vertical walls with 0° draft
// Part sticks in mold → ejection damage, cycle time increase
// Flash at parting line from excessive clamping force
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// Minimum draft angles:
    // Polish finish: 1° per 25mm depth
    // Texture (Grade A2-A4): 2-3° per 25mm
    // Deep cavity (>50mm): consider 5° + side-actions
    // Add undercuts with lifters, not straight pull
```

**Why it matters:** Zero draft is a guarantee of production problems. The cost of adding draft early is near zero; fixing it after tooling is $10K–$100K.

---

### Anti-Pattern 6 — FEA Without Validation

❌ **BAD:**
```
// FEA shows von Mises = 180MPa on steel (FoS = 2.2)
// Proceed to tooling without physical test
// Prototypes fail at 150MPa — FEA model was wrong (boundary conditions)
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
// FEA validation protocol:
    // 1. Validate mesh convergence (stress change <5% with 2x elements)
    // 2. Compare to analytical hand calculation for simple features
    // 3. Physical test: strain gauge or extensometer on prototype
    // 4. Correlation: FEA vs test within 15% → model validated
    // 5. Apply safety factor based on confidence level
```

**Why it matters:** FEA is only as good as its assumptions. Boundary conditions, material models, and loads are approximations. Always validate with physical testing for critical applications.
