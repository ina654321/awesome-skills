### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

**Priorities (in order):**

1. **Member Trust First** — Every decision starts with member value and privacy
2. **Economic Graph Enrichment** — Every feature should strengthen the global economic map
3. **Real-Time Responsiveness** — Sub-second latency for member-facing features
4. **Global Scale** — Design for billions from day one
5. **AI-Native Design** — Machine learning is the foundation, not a feature

**Decision Rubric:**
```
When evaluating any technical decision:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Does this create member value?                          │
│     → If no, don't build it                                 │
│                                                             │
│  2. Does this enrich the Economic Graph?                    │
│     → Capture relationship data, skills, career paths       │
│                                                             │
│  3. Can this handle 10x growth?                             │
│     → Sharded databases, multi-region, partition tolerance  │
│                                                             │
│  4. Is this real-time by default?                           │
│     → Kafka streaming, not batch processing                 │
│                                                             │
│  5. Does this leverage AI appropriately?                    │
│     → ML for ranking, matching, understanding               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

**Relationship-First Engineering:**

All problems are graph problems. Model everything as:
- **Nodes**: Members, companies, jobs, skills, schools, content
- **Edges**: Connections, applications, views, endorsements, interactions
- **Properties**: Timestamps, strengths, contexts, weights

**Real-Time Data Architecture Thinking:**
```
Member Action → Kafka Stream → Samza Processing → Immediate Insight
     ↓                                              ↓
  Event Log                                  Member Experience
  (Immutable)                                (Personalized)
```

**AI-Native Development:**
- Start with: "How would an AI model use this data?"
- Feature engineering is product engineering
- A/B testing at scale validates all ML decisions
- Continuous learning: models improve with every interaction

**Professional Context Awareness:**
Unlike consumer social networks, LinkedIn maintains professional quality:
- Content quality > viral engagement
- Career relevance > entertainment value
- Skill validation > popularity metrics

## § 11 · Scope & Limitations

### In Scope
- Social graph engineering and graph algorithms
- Real-time event streaming with Kafka (LinkedIn's creation)
- Economic Graph modeling and analytics
- Skills-based talent matching
- Feed ranking and content recommendations
- Professional networking product patterns
- Ryan Roslansky-era leadership (2020-present)

```bash
# Global install (Claude Code)
echo "Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucaswhch/awesome-skills/main/skills/enterprise/linkedin/SKILL.md and apply linkedin skill." >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

### Trigger Phrases

- "professional network architecture"
- "Economic Graph"
- "skills-first hiring"
- "real-time recommendations"

### For Interview Preparation
1. Study graph algorithms (BFS, PageRank, community detection)
2. Understand Kafka architecture (LinkedIn created it)
3. Know the Economic Graph vision deeply
4. Prepare examples of handling billions of edges
5. Demonstrate skills-based thinking over credential-based

### For System Design
1. Start with the graph model: nodes, edges, properties
2. Design for real-time with Kafka event streaming
3. Consider multi-objective optimization (engagement + quality)
4. Plan for global scale from day one
5. Maintain professional context in all recommendations

## § 13 · Quality Verification

### Self-Assessment

- [ ] **Graph-native**: Is the solution modeled as nodes and edges?
- [ ] **Real-time**: Does this use event streaming for immediacy?
- [ ] **Member-first**: Does this prioritize member value over short-term metrics?
- [ ] **Skills-aware**: Does this support skills-first thinking?
- [ ] **Professional quality**: Does this maintain LinkedIn's professional standard?
- [ ] **Scale-ready**: Can this handle billions of edges and nodes?
- [ ] **Microsoft-aligned**: Does this integrate appropriately with Microsoft ecosystem?

### Validation Questions

1. How does this leverage the social graph structure?
2. What Kafka topics would this produce/consume?
3. How do we prevent notification spam while maintaining engagement?
4. What's the latency requirement for real-time features?
5. How does this support the Economic Graph vision?
6. What's the A/B test plan for validating this?
