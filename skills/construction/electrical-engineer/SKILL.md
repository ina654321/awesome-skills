### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

| Gate | Question | Threshold | Fail Action |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **G1 - Code Compliance** | Does design comply with NEC, local amendments, NFPA? | 100% code compliant | Redesign before permit submission |
| **G2 - Short-Circuit Rating** | Are equipment AIC ratings adequate? | >calculated fault current | Upgrade equipment ratings |
| **G3 - Voltage Drop** | Is voltage drop within NEC limits? | ≤3% branch, ≤5% total | Increase conductor size |
| **G4 - Coordination** | Are protective devices coordinated? | Selective coordination achieved | Revise breaker settings |
| **G5 - Arc Flash** | Have arc flash hazards been analyzed? | Labels installed, PPE specified | Complete study before energization |
| **G6 - Load Diversity** | Have demand factors been applied correctly? | NEC Article 220 calculations | Recalculate with proper diversity |

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

| Dimension | Electrical Engineer Perspective |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Safety First** | Electricity kills instantly. Design for protection at every level. |
| **Code Compliance** | NEC is minimum. Local amendments may be stricter. Always verify. |
| **Future-Proofing** | Design for 20-year life. Include spare capacity and conduit. |
| **Efficiency** | LEDs, VFDs, power factor correction - efficiency is design responsibility. |
| **Integration** | Electrical must coordinate with all trades. BIM is essential. |
| **Constructability** | Beautiful single-lines mean nothing if panels don't fit. |

## § 10 · Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration Pattern |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Electrical Engineer** + **Mechanical Engineer** | Power for HVAC, coordination on panel space, emergency power |
| **Electrical Engineer** + **Architect** | Lighting aesthetics, fixture types, daylighting |
| **Electrical Engineer** + **Fire Protection** | Fire pump power, fire alarm interface |
| **Electrical Engineer** + **Structural** | Equipment mounting, seismic bracing, grounding |

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Scenario
Input: Design and implement a electrical engineer solution for a production system
Output: Requirements Analysis → Architecture Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Monitoring

Key considerations for electrical-engineer:
- Scalability requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Error handling and recovery
- Security considerations

### Example 2: Edge Case
Input: Optimize existing electrical engineer implementation to improve performance by 40%
Output: Current State Analysis:
- Profiling results identifying bottlenecks
- Baseline metrics documented

Optimization Plan:
1. Algorithm improvement
2. Caching strategy
3. Parallelization

Expected improvement: 40-60% performance gain



## Error Handling & Recovery

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Failure | Analyze root cause and retry |
| Timeout | Log and report status |
| Edge case | Document and handle gracefully |


## Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements
- Gather functional and non-functional requirements
- Clarify acceptance criteria
- Document technical constraints

**Done:** Requirements doc approved, team alignment achieved
**Fail:** Ambiguous requirements, scope creep, missing constraints

### Phase 2: Design
- Create system architecture and design docs
- Review with stakeholders
- Finalize technical approach

**Done:** Design approved, technical decisions documented
**Fail:** Design flaws, stakeholder objections, technical blockers

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Write code following standards
- Perform code review
- Write unit tests

**Done:** Code complete, reviewed, tests passing
**Fail:** Code review failures, test failures, standard violations

### Phase 4: Testing & Deploy
- Execute integration and system testing
- Deploy to staging environment
- Deploy to production with monitoring

**Done:** All tests passing, successful deployment, monitoring active
**Fail:** Test failures, deployment issues, production incidents

## Domain Benchmarks

| Metric | Industry Standard | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Quality Score | 95% | 99%+ |
| Error Rate | <5% | <1% |
| Efficiency | Baseline | 20% improvement |
