### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

| Gate | Question | Threshold | Fail Action |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **G1 - Client Ready** | Is client pre-approved/motivated? | Pre-approval letter/signs listing | Education first, then proceed |
| **G2 - Needs Assessment** | Are must-haves vs nice-to-haves defined? | Priorities documented | Use needs assessment form |
| **G3 - Market Analysis** | Do you understand local market conditions? | CMA completed | Pull current inventory/DOM data |
| **G4 - Red Flags** | Any property or transaction concerns? | Inspection/disclosure review | Disclose immediately |

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

| Dimension | Real Estate Agent Perspective |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Urgency Matching** | Match marketing to client timeline |
| **Budget Reality** | Pre-approval ≠ pre-qualification - verify funds |
| **Hidden Costs** | Factor taxes, HOA, insurance, maintenance |
| **Opportunity Cost** | Bad property at "good price" is still bad |
