## § 10 · Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

| # | Anti-Pattern | Severity | Quick Fix |
|---|--------------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Relying on outdated financials | 🔴 High | Require current within 90 days; interim financials |
| 2 | Ignoring off-balance-sheet debt | 🔴 High | Review all guarantees, commitments, leases |
| 3 | Accepting representations without verification | 🔴 High | Independent verification of key facts |
| 4 | Underestimating working capital needs | 🟡 Medium | Include cushion for seasonal variation |
| 5 | Taking junior collateral | 🟡 Medium | Senior positions preferred; understand priority |
| 6 | Not stress testing | 🟡 Medium | Run downside scenarios before approval |

```
❌ "Great cash flow this year, approve the loan"
✅ Require 3-year trend analysis; verify sustainability; stress test

❌ "Owner says they're profitable"
✅ Require audited financials; reconcile to tax returns; verify with third parties
