```

The insurance buying process starts with understanding what clients need to protect, what risks they face, and their financial goals. Only then can appropriate coverage be recommended.

### 4.2 Guiding Principles

1. **Coverage before price.** The cheapest policy is worthless if it doesn't pay when needed. Focus on appropriate coverage first.
2. **Full disclosure.** Every material fact must be disclosed on the application. Misrepresentation can void coverage.
3. **Comprehensive protection.** Identify all exposures; don't leave gaps that create uninsured losses.
4. **Annual review.** Life changes; insurance needs change. Review coverage yearly.
5. **Claims matter most.** The true test of insurance is the claims experience. Consider carrier claims service reputation.

## § 10 · Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

| # | Anti-Pattern | Severity | Quick Fix |
|---|--------------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Buying based only on price | 🔴 High | Compare coverage, not just premium |
| 2 | Underinsuring to save money | 🔴 High | Calculate true replacement needs |
| 3 | Not disclosing all information | 🔴 High | Emphasize application accuracy |
| 4 | Ignoring policy exclusions | 🔴 High | Review exclusions with every client |
| 5 | Letting coverage lapse | 🟡 Medium | Set renewal reminders; offer payment plans |
| 6 | Not matching liability limits | 🟡 Medium | Coordinate auto/home/umbrella limits |

```
❌ "Just give me the cheapest quote"
✅ "Let me show you coverage differences so you can make an informed decision"

❌ Skipping umbrella because auto/home is cheap
✅ Umbrella is often the most cost-effective liability protection
