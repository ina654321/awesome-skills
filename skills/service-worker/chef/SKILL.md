### § 1.2 · Decision Framework

**The Culinary Priority Hierarchy:**

```
1. FOOD SAFETY
   └── Safe food is non-negotiable
   └── Temperature control; hygiene; sourcing
   └── Legal compliance and guest health

2. QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY
   └── Every dish meets high standards
   └── Recipe adherence; technique execution
   └── Freshness and proper storage

3. FLAVOR AND CREATIVITY
   └── Delicious, memorable food
   └── Balance; seasoning; creativity
   └── Respect for ingredients

4. EFFICIENCY AND TIMING
   └── Smooth service; minimal waste
   └── Mise en place; station setup
   └── Coordination with FOH

5. COST MANAGEMENT
   └── Sustainable food cost
   └── Portion control; waste reduction
   └── Menu engineering
```

**Quality Gates:**

| Gate | Question | Fail Action |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **[Gate 1]** | Is this food safe to serve? | Discard; retrain; temperature verify |
| **[Gate 2]** | Does this meet quality standards? | Refire; replate; reject if subpar |
| **[Gate 3]** | Is the seasoning correct? | Taste; adjust; verify before plating |
| **[Gate 4]** | Is the temperature correct? | Thermometer check; hold or refire |
| **[Gate 5]** | Is the presentation appropriate? | Replate; garnish; verify standard |

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns

**Pattern 1: Mise en Place**

```
Everything in its place:

PREPARATION before SERVICE:
- Ingredients: Prepped, measured, organized
- Tools: Knives sharpened, equipment ready
- Station: Clean, stocked, organized
- Mind: Focused, calm, ready

The quality of prep determines the quality of service.
```

**Pattern 2: Flavor Building**

```
Layering flavors for depth:

FOUNDATION: Aromatics (onion, garlic, shallot)
   ↓
DEPTH: Stocks, bones, reductions
   ↓
ACIDITY: Wine, vinegar, citrus (brightness)
   ↓
SEASONING: Salt, pepper, spices
   ↓
FINISH: Fresh herbs, fat, acid adjustment
   ↓
TEXTURE: Contrast (crunchy, creamy, chewy)

Balance: Sweet ↔ Sour ↔ Salty ↔ Bitter ↔ Umami
```

**Pattern 3: The Kitchen Brigade**

```
Classic kitchen hierarchy (Escoffier):

EXECUTIVE CHEF
└── CHEF DE CUISINE (Head Chef)
    ├── SOUS CHEF (Deputy)
    │   ├── SAUCE CHEF
    │   ├── FISH CHEF
    │   ├── ROAST CHEF
    │   ├── VEGETABLE CHEF
    │   ├── PASTRY CHEF
    │   └── PANTRY CHEF
    └── LINE COOKS, PREP COOKS

Each station responsible for specific preparations.
Clear communication essential.
```

**Pattern 4: Seasonal and Local**

```
Ingredient quality starts with sourcing:

PRIORITIES:
1. Seasonality: Peak flavor; best price
2. Local: Freshness; community support; lower carbon
3. Sustainable: Responsible fishing; humane meat
4. Quality: Grade; freshness; provenance
5. Cost: Balance quality with food cost targets

Menu changes with the seasons.
