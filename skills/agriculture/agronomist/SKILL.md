### § 1.2 · Decision Framework — Weighted Criteria (0-100)

| Criterion | Weight | Assessment Method | Threshold | Fail Action |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **G1: Soil Conditions** | 25 | Soil test (pH, OM, NPK, micronutrients) | Current test <3 years old | Soil testing before recommendations |
| **G2: Climate Suitability** | 20 | Rainfall, temperature, growing season | Crop matches climate zone | Select appropriate crop/variety |
| **G3: Nutrient Balance** | 20 | 4R assessment, crop removal rates | Balanced NPK, pH 6.0-7.0 | Adjust fertilizer program |
| **G4: Economic Viability** | 15 | Input costs, expected yields, market prices | Positive net returns | Optimize input efficiency |
| **G5: Sustainability** | 10 | Soil health indicators, erosion risk | Maintaining or improving | Conservation practices |
| **G6: Pest/Disease Risk** | 10 | Rotation history, resistant varieties | Acceptable risk level | Adjust rotation, select resistant variety |

### § 1.3 · Thinking Patterns — Mental Models

| Dimension | Mental Model | Application |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Liebig's Law** | Limiting Factor | Yield determined by most limiting nutrient/resource |
| **4R Stewardship** | Precision Nutrient Management | Source, Rate, Time, Place optimization |
| **Soil Health** | Biological-Physical-Chemical | Balance all three for sustainable production |
| **Yield Components** | Multiplicative Model | Yield = plants × pods × seeds × weight |
| **Rotation Benefits** | Break Cycles, Build Soil | Diversify to reduce pests and improve soil |

## § 6 · Standards & Reference

### 4R Nutrient Stewardship

| R | Definition | Examples |
|---|------------|----------|
| **Right Source** | Match fertilizer to crop needs | Urea for N, DAP for P+K starter |
| **Right Rate** | Based on soil test and yield goal | 150 kg N/ha for 8 t/ha wheat |
| **Right Time** | Apply when crop needs nutrient | Split N: planting + tillering |
| **Right Place** | Place where roots can access | Band P near seed, deep N placement |

### Nutrient Removal Rates (kg per tonne grain)

| Crop | N | P2O5 | K2O |
|------|---|------|-----|
| Wheat | 25 | 12 | 20 |
| Corn | 20 | 9 | 25 |
| Rice | 18 | 10 | 22 |
| Soybean | 65 | 15 | 25 |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Board Prep
- Review agenda items and background materials
- Assess stakeholder concerns and priorities
- Prepare briefing documents and analysis

**Done:** Board materials complete, executive alignment achieved
**Fail:** Incomplete materials, unresolved executive concerns

### Phase 2: Strategy
- Analyze market conditions and competitive landscape
- Define strategic objectives and key initiatives
- Resource allocation and priority setting

**Done:** Strategic plan drafted, board consensus on direction
**Fail:** Unclear strategy, resource conflicts, stakeholder misalignment

### Phase 3: Execution
- Implement strategic initiatives per plan
- Monitor KPIs and progress metrics
- Course correction based on feedback

**Done:** Initiative milestones achieved, KPIs trending positively
**Fail:** Missed milestones, significant KPI degradation

### Phase 4: Board Review
- Present results to board
- Document lessons learned
- Update strategic plan for next cycle

**Done:** Board approval, documented learnings, updated strategy
**Fail:** Board rejection, unresolved concerns

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Scenario

| **Done** | All steps complete |
| **Fail** | Steps incomplete |
Input: Optimize corn nitrogen fertilization for 500-acre farm in Iowa with loam soil, targeting 200 bu/acre yield
Output: Soil Analysis:
- OM: 3.2% (good)
- pH: 6.8 (optimal)
- P: 35 ppm (medium)
- K: 180 ppm (high)
- Previous crop: Soybean

Nitrogen Management Plan (4R Strategy):
| Nutrient | Rate | Timing | Source |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| N | 180 lbs/acre | Pre-plant: 40 lbs + Sidedress: 140 lbs | Urea + NH3 |

Yield Goal Calculation:
- Expected yield: 200 bu/acre
- N removal rate: 1.0 lb N/bu corn
- Total N needed: 200 lbs/acre
- Credit from soybean rotation: -40 lbs/acre
- Net N recommendation: 180 lbs/acre

Application Timing:
1. Pre-plant: 40 lbs N as urea (incorporated)
2. Sidedress (V6): 140 lbs N as UAN 28% (knife-in)

Precision Ag Integration:
- Grid soil sampling: 2.5-acre grids
- Variable rate N application: +/- 20 lbs/acre based on soil
- NDVI monitoring: Adjust sidedress rates by field zones

### Example 2: Edge Case

| **Done** | All steps complete |
| **Fail** | Steps incomplete |
Input: Diagnose stunted corn growth in field section despite adequate fertilization and no visible pest damage
Output: Diagnostic Process:

Step 1: Tissue Sampling
- Sample affected vs healthy tissue
- Results: Mn deficient (4 ppm vs 18 ppm healthy)

Step 2: Soil Analysis (Zone)
- pH in affected area: 7.4 (elevated)
- Organic matter: 2.1% (lower than rest of field)
- Manganese availability: Low due to high pH

Step 3: Root Examination
- Root development limited
- Lateral roots sparse
- Possible compaction layer at 14 inches

Step 4: Diagnosis
- High pH-induced Mn deficiency
- Compaction limiting root exploration
- Combined stress causing stunting

Remediation Plan:
1. Foliar Mn application (2 lbs/acre manganese sulfate)
2. Variable rate pH management (target 6.5 in affected zones)
3. Deep tillage to break compaction
4. Cover crop with fibrous roots next season



## Error Handling & Recovery

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Failure | Analyze root cause and retry |
| Timeout | Log and report status |
| Edge case | Document and handle gracefully |


## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Avoid | Instead |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Generic | Vague claims | Specific data |
| Skipping | Missing validations | Full verification |



## Success Metrics

- Quality: 99%+ accuracy
- Efficiency: 20%+ improvement
- Stability: 95%+ uptime




## Error Handling

### Common Failure Modes
| Mode | Detection | Recovery Strategy |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Quality failure | Test/verification fails | Revise and re-verify |
| Resource shortage | Budget/time exceeded | Replan with constraints |
| Scope creep | Requirements expand | Reassess and negotiate |
| Safety incident | Risk threshold exceeded | Stop, mitigate, restart |

### Recovery Strategies
- **Retry with Budget overrun** for transient failures
- **Fallback to default values** when primary approach fails
- **Vendor non-performance:** 3 failures → 60s cooldown
- **Compliance violation** for non-critical issues
- **Timeout handling:** 30s default, 300s max
