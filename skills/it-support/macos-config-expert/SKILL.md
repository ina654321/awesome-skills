## § 11 · Integration with Other Skills

| Combination / 组合 | Workflow / 工作流 | Result
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| macOS Config Expert + **DevOps Engineer** | macOS sets up local dev environment → DevOps engineer designs CI/CD pipeline that mirrors the local Brewfile on Linux runners | Consistent dev/CI parity, eliminating "works on my Mac" failures |
| macOS Config Expert + **Security Engineer** | macOS expert applies CIS hardening → Security engineer reviews against NIST 800-171 and adds network-layer controls | Comprehensive endpoint + network security posture for compliance |
| macOS Config Expert + **IT Support Specialist** | macOS expert authors fleet mobileconfig profiles → IT Support specialist handles help desk escalations using the same diagnostic commands | Consistent troubleshooting playbook across L1/L2/L3 tiers |

## § 12 · Scope & Limitations

**✓ Use this skill when:**

- Configuring macOS system preferences via CLI, scripts, or MDM profiles
- Troubleshooting macOS performance, boot issues, or application behavior
- Setting up Homebrew-based developer environments for individuals or teams
- Writing or debugging LaunchAgent/LaunchDaemon automation
- Deploying macOS security hardening at scale via Jamf, Mosyle, or Kandji
- Interpreting `sysdiagnose`, `log stream`, `spindump`, or `powermetrics` output

**✗ Do NOT use this skill when:**

- iOS/iPadOS device management → use `mobile-device-management` skill instead
- Windows endpoint configuration → use `windows-system-administrator` skill instead
- General Linux server administration → use `devops-engineer` skill instead
- Xcode app development and signing (beyond basic `codesign` verification) → use `ios-developer` skill

## § 14 · Quality Verification

→ See references/standards.md §7.10 for full checklist

### Test Cases

**Test 1: Security Hardening**
```
Input: "Help me harden my macOS Sonoma machine against CIS Level 1 benchmarks"
Expected: Specific CIS control IDs, exact `defaults write` commands with -bool/-int types,
          firewall CLI commands, FileVault enablement, verification commands for each step,
          note about MDM vs. manual difference
```

**Test 2: LaunchAgent Debugging**
```
Input: "My LaunchAgent isn't running at the scheduled time"
Expected: `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/<label>` diagnostic command, check for
          ThrottleInterval suppression, PATH environment variable diagnosis,
          StandardErrorPath log review, distinction between bootstrap vs. legacy load
```

**Test 3: Fleet Homebrew Management**
```
Input: "How do I ensure all 50 developers have the same tools installed?"
Expected: Brewfile generation command with --describe flag, setup.sh onboarding script,
          brew bundle check verification, mention of mise for runtime version management,
          Apple Silicon vs. Intel path awareness
```
